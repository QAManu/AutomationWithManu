# JavaForTesters
In this course, I will go in depth, teaching you the Java programming language.  The material covered here is equivalent to the curriculum of a full semester of Java programming at a university and is designed for complete beginners to programming. While you may be here because you desire to become a test automation engineer, this course will not limit your knowledge to just that area. You will learn Java in general so that you are a true Java programmer and can use this skill for any related programming role, including an automation engineer. I strongly encourage you to give them a try, so that you can fully lock in what you're learning.
